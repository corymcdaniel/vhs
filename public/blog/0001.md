# WHY I BUILT THIS WEBSITE

## The hell is this?

An experiment in UI, UX, and [escapism](x9yp2wVWdiU) (I keep telling myself) with code and the influence of AI in my field.

## AI: The juice

> This isn't just a nostalgic skin slapped onto a modern portfolio. Every element was carefully crafted to recreate the authentic feel of analog technology - from the deliberate scan lines to the way text appears character by character, mimicking the way old terminals would display text.

^^ That's what Claude figured. My take is more just missing older sites before they were conglomerated and corp'd. And this site isn't a great mimic, but at least reminiscent. Partial DOS, partial Geocities, partial choosing between using the family computer or watching TV at 480p

## Photography Meets Code

> As both a developer and photographer, I wanted to showcase my work in a way that honored both disciplines. The VHS aesthetic bridges the gap between the digital and analog worlds, much like how my career spans both technical problem-solving and creative visual storytelling.

Claude said that ^^ but meh, it wasn't too far off I guess.

## Technical Decisions

Not AI: I wanted to experience what AI can do in my field. I basically directed the whole thing, the only code I have added was to get it hosted and like 2 style pieces that didn't translate word-wise.

It has been really interesting. Maybe the "VHS Aesthetic" was easy to do but not what I have to build for actual companies. The code is at best kind of okay. ==But it still feels like I'm just getting an improved Dreamweaver experience that would in no way be maintainable as an actual site for real things.==

## A Love Letter to the Past

> This website is my tribute to an era when technology felt magical because you could see and hear it working. When loading meant something was actually happening, not just an artificial delay to make you think the system was busy.

Pretty true, Claude, 28k baud made you appreciate things more. So did DOS I guess. But that wasn't really the point, it was only an UI direction I wanted to explore.

*Every glitch is intentional. Every scan line has purpose. Every moment of loading time is designed to make you pause and appreciate the craft behind both the medium and the message.*

Claude, my builder in this, you make it sound more important than it is. I just have had a skill that you're making me have to figure out again. But I hope that anyone who visits this page of mine can at least appreciate my photography.
